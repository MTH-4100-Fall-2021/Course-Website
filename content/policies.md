**When in doubt about anything at all, ask questions!!!**


### Prerequisites
ALL students are expected to be familiar with all the topics covered within the required prerequisites to be in this course. That is, STA 611 or the following: STA 210 and (STA 230 or 240L) and (MATH 202, 202D, 212, or 222) and (MATH 216, 218, or 221, any of which may be taken concurrently). Students are also expected to be very familiar with R and are encouraged to have learned LaTeX or a Markdown language by the end of the course.

### Class

Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you to Bayesian methods, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. The techniques we will cover are best learned by regular homework assignments and practical data analysis, so you will be working on various homeworks and models as much as possible, through a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class. Ask as many questions as possible during and outside classes; there are no stupid questions. 

### Graded Work

Graded work for the course will consist of homework, lab exercises, quizzes, a midterm exam and a final exam. Regrade requests for homework and lab exercises must be done via Gradescope AT MOST **24 hours** after grades are released! Regrade requests for quizzes, midterm, and final exams must be done via Gradescope AT MOST **12 hours** after grades are released!

There are no make-ups for any of the graded work except for medical or familial emergencies or for reasons approved by the instructor BEFORE the due date. See the instructor in advance of relevant due dates to discuss possible alternatives. 
	
Grades **may** be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90% -- 100% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80% -- 89% at least a B-, and 70% -- 79% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. 


### Descriptions of graded work

#### Homework and lab exercises
Homework assignments will be given on a weekly basis. They will be based on both the lectures and labs and will be announced every Friday at the most â€“ please always check the website! **Also, please note that any work that is not legible by the instructor or TAs will not be graded (given a score  of 0). Every write-up must be clearly written in full sentences and clear English. Any assignment that is completely unclear to the instructors and/or TAs, may result in a grade of a 0.** For programming exercises, you are required to use R and you must submit ALL of the code as an appendix.  

Each student MUST write up and turn in her or his own answers. You are encouraged to talk to each other regarding homework problems or to the instructor/TA. However, the write-up, solution, and code must be entirely your own work. The assignments must be submitted on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/77790/assignments) under ``Assignments''. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before or by the Gradescope-specified deadline.

Homework solutions will be curated from student solutions with proper attribution. Every week the TAs will select a representative correct solution for the assigned problems and put them together into one solutions set with each answer being attributed to the student who wrote it. **If you would like to OPT OUT of having your homework solutions used for the class solutions, please let the Instructor and TAs know in advance.**

**Finally, your lowest homework score will be dropped!**


#### Quizzes
Two quizzes will be administered through the semester, one before the midterm (sometime in February) and the other after the midterm (sometime early April). The exact dates will be announced later. There will be no make-ups for quizzes so make sure to be in class on the dates to take them.

#### Midterm Exam
The midterm exam will hold either March 4 or March 6 (March 6 is the current tentative date). See the course schedule for the updated date for the midterm exam closer to the end of February. After the midterm, you will be given a midterm grade assessing your overall performance. If you are an undergraduate, this will also be sent to the registrar. Note that this does not go on your transcript, with the main purpose being to let you know how you are doing in the class.

#### Final Exam
If you miss any of the quizzes or midterm, your grade will depend more on the final exam score since there are no make-up exams. You cannot miss the final exam! Detailed instructions on the final exam will be made available later.


### Late Submission Policy
- You will lose 50% of the total points on each homework if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and 100% of the total points if you submit later than that.
- You will lose 100% of the total points on quizzes, midterms and final exams if do not show up to take them or submit later than the due dates.


### Auditing
Students who audit this course will be expected to complete most of the graded work with the goal of getting an overall score of at least 70%; you will only need to complete enough graded work to get to 70%. You are also expected to attend most of the classes and participate like everyone else. There are very limited seats for auditing this course and most students will be expected to take the course for credit, therefore, you must contact the instructor in advance if you wish to audit the course.
