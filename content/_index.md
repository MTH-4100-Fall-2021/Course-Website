### Course Overview
Bayesian methods are increasingly important in both industry and academia. This is a graduate-level course, within the Department of Statistical Science, that introduces students to the basics of Bayesian inference and provides students with the tools needed to fit Bayesian models. 

In this course, you will learn the importance of Bayesian methods and inference. You will be introduced to Bayesian theory, with particular emphasis on conceptual foundations as well as implementation and model fitting. You will learn the essential distinctions between classical and Bayesian methods and become familiar with the origins of Bayesian inference. You will also learn about conjugate families of distributions and why they are very convenient, and how to conduct Bayesian inference with intractable posterior distributions,  when you do not have conjugate distributions.

Although this course emphasizes the mathematical theory behind Bayesian inference, data analysis and interpretation of results are also important components. Students who wish to explore the mathematical theory in more detail than what is covered in class are welcome to engage with and request further reading materials from the instructor outside of class. Also, all students must have the theoretical background covered in the prerequisites to be able to keep up with and understand the materials. 


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

-  Understand the basics of Bayesian inference, that is, be able to define likelihood functions, prior distributions, posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions.
- Derive posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions, for common likelihood-prior combinations of distributions.
- Interpret the results of fitted models and conduct checks to ascertain that the models have converged.
- Use the Bayesian methods and models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
- Assess the adequacy of Bayesian models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given data set.


### Updates Effective from March 23

<font color="darkred">As most (and hopefully all) of you know by now, classes will be moving online, following Duke University directives, given the current situation with respect to COVID-19. Consequently, I have highlighted the most important changes to the syllabus (and more generally, the website) in red, so please pay special attention to those.</font>
