### Course Overview
Bayesian methods are increasingly important in both industry and academia. This is an upper level undergraduate-course for students registered in STA 360, and a graduate-level course for students registered in STA 602. This is an asynchronous online course that introduces students to the basics of Bayesian inference and provides students with the tools needed to fit Bayesian models. Asynchronous here means that there will be no standard meeting time, so that students are able to participate according to their own schedule. That said, the course is designed to align with the standard six-week Term II schedule of the summer school calendar. Therefore, there will be set deadlines to ensure that all course materials and assessments are completed in six weeks.

In this course, you will learn the importance of Bayesian methods and inference. You will be introduced to Bayesian theory, with particular emphasis on conceptual foundations as well as implementation and model fitting. You will learn the essential distinctions between classical and Bayesian methods and become familiar with the origins of Bayesian inference. You will also learn about conjugate families of distributions and why they are very convenient, and how to conduct Bayesian inference with intractable posterior distributions,  when you do not have conjugate distributions.

Although this course emphasizes the mathematical theory behind Bayesian inference, data analysis and interpretation of results are also important components. Students who wish to explore the mathematical theory in more detail than what is covered in class are welcome to engage with and request further reading materials from the instructor. Also, all students must have the theoretical background covered in the prerequisites to be able to keep up with and understand the materials. 


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

-  Understand the basics of Bayesian inference, that is, be able to define likelihood functions, prior distributions, posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions.
- Derive posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions, for common likelihood-prior combinations of distributions.
- Interpret the results of fitted models and conduct checks to ascertain that the models have converged.
- Use the Bayesian methods and models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
- Assess the adequacy of Bayesian models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given data set.




### Course Info

#### Meeting Times

There will be no **fully synchronous** meetings. There will be pre-recorded lecture videos for each topic. There will be Zoom discussion sessions every day (see below for times), but those will be recorded and shared with all students. Students are **strongly encouraged** to attend the live sessions and ask questions but students who prefer not to can watch the recordings.

#### Online Labs

These are live **optional** lab sessions on Zoom  for students who wish to attend. Recordings will be made available afterwards for students who prefer not to.

### Materials

Lecture notes and slides, lab exercises and assigned readings will be posted on the course website, while lecture and lab videos will be posted on Sakai. White boards will also be used frequently in the lecture videos, so please pay special attention to those. Finally, we will closely follow the main textbook so students should make sure to always read the corresponding textbook chapters in the assigned readings.
