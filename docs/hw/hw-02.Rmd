## Instructions

This assignment involves one parameter models and Monte Carlo approximations. Please make sure your final output file is a pdf document. You can submit handwritten solutions for non-programming exercises or type them using R Markdown, LaTeX or any other word processor. All programming exercises must be done in R, typed up clearly and with all code attached. Submissions should be made on gradescope: go to Assignments $\rightarrow$ Homework 2.

## Questions

1. Let $$y_1,\ldots,y_n \overset{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Ga}(a,b)$$ with $a$ known (so we only wish to infer $b$).
    + Find the conjugate family of priors for $b$.
    + Find the corresponding posterior given the prior you identified in the previous part.
    + Give an interpretation of the prior parameters as things like "prior mean", "prior variance", "prior sample size", etc.

2. Hoff 3.3

3. Hoff 4.1

4. <font color="blue">**How many samples is enough?**</font> Recall the birth rates example from the slides.
    + Sample from the posterior distribution for women who are college educated using $m$ = 10, 100, and 1000 Monte Carlo samples. For each $m$, make a plot of the random draws and on the same plot, mark the points corresponding to the posterior mean and the 95% equal-tailed credible interval (quantile-based). How do those compare to the true posterior mean and 95% quantile-based CI?
    
    +  In addition, calculate the posterior probability that $\theta_2 < 1.5$ in each case.
    
    + How large should $m$ be if $95\%$ of the time we want the difference between the Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior mean and the true posterior mean (which we know in this case) to be $\leq 0.001$?
