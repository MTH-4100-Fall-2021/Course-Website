## Instructions

Please make sure your final output file is a pdf document. You can submit handwritten solutions for non-programming exercises or type them using R Markdown, LaTeX or any other word processor. All programming exercises must be done in R, typed up clearly and with all code attached. Submissions should be made on gradescope: go to Assignments $\rightarrow$ Homework 4.

## Questions

1. Hoff problem 6.1
    + <font color="blue">**Part (a): 2 points**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (b): 3 points**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (c): 3 points**</font>
    + <font color="blue">**Part (d): 3 points**</font>

2. <font color="green">**Continuation of question 4 from homework 3.**</font> Suppose we have count data $y_i$ with $(i = 1,\ldots, n)$, where $x_i = 0$ for control subjects and $x_i = 1$ for treated subjects. Consider the following model for the data: $$y_i \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda \gamma^{x_i}),$$ where $\lambda = \mathbb{E}[y_i | x_i = 0]$ and $\gamma$ is a multiplicative change in the mean in the treated group. Choose gamma priors for the parameters $\lambda$ and $\gamma$, $$\lambda \sim \textrm{Ga}(1,1),\ \ \ \gamma \sim \textrm{Ga}(1,1).$$
You should already have the correct posterior density from homework 3.
    + <font color="green">**Part (a):**</font>  Derive the full conditional distributions for $\lambda$ and $\gamma$.  
    <font color="blue">**(3 points)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (b):**</font>  Simulate data in which n = 100, with 50 in each group, where $\lambda = \gamma = 1$, and generate samples from the posterior distribution for these data.  
    <font color="blue">**(3 points)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (c):**</font>  Use your code to (i) estimate the posterior mean and a 95% credible interval for $\textrm{log}(\lambda)$; and (ii) estimate the predictive distribution for subjects having $x_i = 0$ and $x_i = 1$. Are these predictive distributions different?  
    <font color="blue">**(2 points)**</font>
    + <font color="green">**Part (d):**</font>  Run convergence diagnostics -- is your chain mixing well? What is the effective sample size? Does the mixing differ for $\lambda$ and $\gamma$?  
    <font color="blue">**(1 point)**</font>
