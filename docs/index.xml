      <description>Supplementary Textbooks These textbooks are great resources for some of the topics we will cover. You do not need to buy them, but you may be able to borrow them from Duke library should you need extra reading materials, besides the class slides and main textbooks.
     R and R Markdown Resources R Markdown can be used to create high quality reports and presentations with embedded chunks of R code.</description>
