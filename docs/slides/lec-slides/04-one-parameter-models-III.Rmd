# Loss functions and Bayes risk


---
## Bayes estimate

- As we've seen by now, having posterior distributions instead of one-number summaries is great for capturing uncertainty.

--

- That said, it is still very appealing to have simple summaries, especially when dealing with clients or collaborators from other fields, who desire one.

--

- Can we obtain a single estimate of $\theta$ based on the posterior? Sure!

--

- .hlight[Bayes estimate] is the value $\hat{\theta}$, that minimizes the Bayes risk.

--

- .hlight[Bayes risk] is defined as the expected loss averaged over the posterior distribution.

--

- Put differently, a .hlight[Bayes estimate] $\hat{\theta}$ has the lowest posterior expected loss.

--

- <div class="question">
That's fine, but what does expected loss mean?
</div>

--

- .hlight[Frequentist risk] also exists but we won't go into that here.



---
## Loss functions

- A .hlight[loss function] $L(\theta,\delta(y))$ is a function of a parameter $\theta$, where $\delta(y)$ is some .hlight[decision] about $\theta$, based on just the data $y$.

--

- For example, $\delta(y) = \bar{y}$ can be the decision to use the sample mean to estimate $\theta$, the true population mean.

--

- $L(\theta,\delta(y))$ determines the penalty for making the decision $\delta(y)$, if $\theta$ is the true parameter; $L(\theta,\delta(y))$ characterizes the price paid for errors.

--

- A common choice for example, when dealing with point estimation, is the .hlight[squared error loss], which has
.block[
.small[
$$L(\theta,\delta(y)) = (\theta - \delta(y))^2.$$
]
]

--

- Bayes risk is thus
.block[
.small[
$$\rho(\theta,\delta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\ L(\theta,\delta(y)) | \ y\right] = \int L(\theta,\delta(y)) \ p(\theta|y) \ d\theta,$$
]
]

  and we proceed to find the value $\hat{\theta}$, that is, the decision $\delta(y)$, that minimizes the Bayes risk.



---
## Bayes estimator under squared error loss

- Turns out that, under squared error loss, the decision $\delta(y)$ that minimizes the posterior risk is the posterior mean.

--

- Proof: Let $L(\theta,\delta(y)) = (\theta - \delta(y))^2$. Then,
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho(\theta,\delta) & = \int L(\theta,\delta(y)) \ p(\theta|y) \ d\theta.\\
& = \int (\theta - \delta(y))^2 \ p(\theta|y) \ d\theta.\\
\end{aligned}
$$
]
]

--

- Expand, then take the partial derivative of $\rho(\theta,\delta)$ with respect to $\delta(y)$.

--

- <div class="question">
To be continued on the board!
</div>

--

- Easy to see then that $\delta(y) = \mathbb{E}[\theta | x]$ is the minimizer.

--

- Well that's great! The posterior mean is often very easy to calculate in most cases. In the beta-binomial case, we have
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\theta} = \frac{a+y}{a+b+n}.$$
]
]



---
## What about other loss functions?

- Clearly, squared error is only one possible loss function. An alternative is .hlight[absolute loss], which has
.block[
.small[
$$L(\theta,\delta(y)) = |\theta - \delta(y)|.$$
]
]

--

- Absolute loss places less of a penalty on large deviations & the resulting Bayes estimate is **posterior median**.

--

- Median is actually relatively easy to estimate.

--

- Recall that for a continuous random variable $Y$ with cdf $F$, the median of the distribution is the value $z$, which satisfies
.block[
.small[
$$F(z) = \Pr(Y\leq z) = \dfrac{1}{2}= \Pr(Y\geq z) = 1-F(z).$$
]
]

--

- As long as we know how to evaluate the CDF of the distribution we have, we can solve for $z$. 

--

- Think R!



---
## What about other loss functions?

- For the beta-binomial model, the CDF of the beta posterior can be written as
.block[
.small[
$$F(z) = \Pr(\theta\leq z | y) = \int^z_0 \textrm{beta}(\theta; a+y, b+n-y) d\theta.$$
]
]

--

- Then, if $\hat{\theta}$ is the median, we have that $F(\hat{\theta}) = 0.5$.

--

- To solve for $\hat{\theta}$, apply the inverse CDF $\hat{\theta} = F^{-1}(0.5)$.

--

- In R, that's simply
    ```{r eval=F}
qbeta(0.5,a+y,b+n-y)
```

--

- For other popular distributions, switch out the beta.



---
## Loss functions and decisions

- Loss functions are not specific to estimation problems but are a critical part of decision making.

--

- For example, suppose you are deciding how much money to bet ($A) on Duke in the first UNC-Duke men's basketball game this year (next month).

--

- Suppose, if Duke
  + loses (y = 0), you lose the amount you bet ($A)
  + wins (y = 1), you gain B per $1 bet
  
--

- <div class="question">
What is a good sampling distribution for y here?
</div>
  
--

- Then, the loss function can be characterized as
.block[
.small[
$$L(A,y) = A(1-y) - y(BA),$$
]
]
  
  with your action being the amount bet A.
  
--

- <div class="question">
When will your bet be "rational"?
</div>



---
## How much to bet on Duke?

- $y$ is an unknown state, but we can think of it as a new prediction $y_{n+1}$ given that we have data from win-loss records $(y_{1:n})$ that can be converted into a Bayesian posterior,
.block[
.small[
$$\theta \sim \textrm{beta}(a_n,b_n),$$
]
]

--
  with this posterior concentrated slightly to the left of 0.5, if we only use data on UNC-Duke games (UNC men lead Duke 139-112 all time).
  
--

- Actually, it might make more sense to focus on more recent head-to-head data and not the all time record.

--

- In fact, we might want to build a model that predicts the outcome of the game using historical data & predictors (current team rankings, injuries, etc).

--

- However, to keep it simple for this illustration, go with the posterior above.



---
## How much to bet on Duke?

- The Bayes risk for action A is then the expectation of the loss function,
.block[
.small[
$$\rho(A) = \mathbb{E}\left[\ L(A,y) | \ y_{1:n}\right].$$
]
]

--

- To calculate this as a function of $A$ and find the optimal $A$, we need to marginalize over the **posterior predictive distribution** for $y$.

--

- <div class="question">
Why are we using the posterior predictive distribution here instead of the posterior distribution?
</div>

--

- Recall from the last class that
.block[
.small[
$$p(y_{n+1}|y_{1:n}) = \dfrac{a_n^{y_{n+1}} b_n^{1-y_{n+1}}}{a_n + b_n}; \ \ \ y_{n+1}=0,1.$$
]
]

--

- Specifically, that the posterior predictive distribution here is $\textrm{Bernoulli}(\hat{\theta})$, with
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\theta} = \dfrac{a_n}{a_n + b_n}$$
]
]

--

- By the way, what do $a_n$ and $b_n$ represent?



---
## How much to bet on Duke?

- With the loss function $L(A,y) = A(1-y) - y(BA)$, and using the notation $y_{n+1}$ instead of $y$ (to make it obvious the game has not been played), the Bayes risk (expected loss) for bet $A$ is
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\rho(A) & = \mathbb{E}\left[\ L(A,y_{n+1}) | \ y_{1:n}\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[A(1-y_{n+1}) - y_{n+1}(BA) | \ y_{1:n}\right]\\
& = A \ \mathbb{E}\left[1-y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right]  - (BA) \ \mathbb{E}\left[y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right]\\
& = A \ \left(1 -  \mathbb{E}\left[y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right] \right)  - (BA) \ \mathbb{E}\left[y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right]\\
& = A \ \left(1 -\mathbb{E}\left[y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right](1+B) \right).
\end{split}
$$
]
]

--

- Hence, your bet is rational as long as
.block[
.small[
$$\mathbb{E}\left[y_{n+1} | \ y_{1:n}\right](1+B) > 1.$$
]
]

--

- Clearly, there is no limit to the amount you should bet if this condition is satisfied (the loss function is clearly too simple).

--

- Loss function needs to be carefully chosen to lead to a good decision - finite resources, diminishing returns, limits on donations, etc.

--

# Frequentist vs Bayesian intervals



---
## Frequentist confidence intervals

- Recall that a frequentist confidence interval  $[l(y); u(y)]$ has 95% frequentist coverage for a population parameter $\theta$ if, before we collect the data,
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[l(y) < \theta < u(y) | \theta] = 0.95.$$
]
]

--

- This means that 95% of the time, our constructed interval will cover the true parameter, and 5% of the time it won't.

--

- In any given sample, you don't know whether you're in the lucky 95% or the unlucky 5%.

--

- You just know that either the interval covers the parameter, or it doesn't (useful, but not too helpful clearly). There is NOT a 95% chance your interval covers the true parameter once you have collected the data.

--

- Asking about the definition of a confidence interval is tricky, even for those who know what they're doing.



---
## Bayesian intervals

- An interval $[l(y); u(y)]$ has 95% Bayesian coverage for $\theta$ if
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[l(y) < \theta < u(y) | Y=y] = 0.95.$$
]
]

--

- This describes our information about where $\theta$ lies _after_ we observe the data.

--

- Fantastic!

--

- This is actually the interpretation people want to give to the frequentist confidence interval.

--

- Bayesian interval estimates are often generally called .hlight[credible intervals].



---
## Bayesian quantile-based interval

- The easiest way to obtain a Bayesian interval estimate is to use posterior quantiles.

--

- Easy since we either know the posterior densities exactly or can sample from the distributions.

--

- To make a $100 \times (1-\alpha)%$ quantile-based credible interval, find numbers (quantiles) $\theta_{\alpha/2} < \theta_{1-\alpha/2}$ such that

  1. $\Pr(\theta < \theta_{\alpha/2} | Y=y) = \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$; and
  
  2. $\Pr(\theta > \theta_{1-\alpha/2} | Y=y) = \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$.
  
--

- This is an .hlight[equal-tailed interval]. Often when researchers refer to a credible interval, this is what they mean.



---
## Equal-tailed quantile-based interval

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="370px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hpd.png")
```

- This is Figure 3.6 from the Hoff book. Focus on the quantile-based credible interval for now.

--

- Note that there are values of $\theta$ outside the quantile-based credible interval, with higher density than some values inside the interval. This suggests that we can do better with interval estimation.



---
## HPD region

- A $100 \times (1-\alpha)%$ highest posterior density (HPD) region is a subset $s(y)$ of the parameter space $\Theta$ such that

  1. $\Pr(\theta \in s(y) | Y=y) = 1-\alpha$; and
  
  2. If $\theta_a \in s(y)$ and $\theta_b \notin s(y)$, then $\Pr(\theta_a | Y=y) > \Pr(\theta_b | Y=y)$.

--

- $\Rightarrow$ **All** points in a HPD region have higher posterior density than points outside the region. 

  *Note this region is not necessarily a single interval (e.g., in the case of a multimodal posterior).*
  
--

- The basic idea is to gradually move a horizontal line down across the density, including in the HPD region all values of $\theta$ with a density above the horizontal line.

--

- Stop moving the line down when the posterior probability of the values of $\theta$ in the region reaches $1-\alpha$.



---
## HPD region

Hoff Figure 3.6 shows how to construct an HPD region.

# Poisson-gamma model



---
## Poisson distribution recap

- $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n \overset{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Po}(\theta)$ denotes that each $Y_i$ is a .hlight[Poisson random variable].

--

- The Poisson distribution is commonly used to model count data consisting of the number of events in a given time interval.

--

- Some examples: # children, # lifetime romantic partners, # songs on iPhone, # tumors on mouse, etc.

--

- The Poisson distribution is parameterized by $\theta$ and the pmf is given by
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[Y_i = y_i | \theta] = \dfrac{\theta^y_i e^{-\theta}}{y_i!}; \ \ \ \ y_i=0,1,2,\ldots; \ \ \ \ \theta > 0.$$
]
]

  where
.block[
.small[
$$\mathbb{E}[Y_i] = \mathbb{V}[Y_i] = \theta.$$
]
]

--

- <div class="question">
What is the joint likelihood? What is the best guess (MLE) for the Poisson parameter? What is the sufficient statistic for the Poisson parameter?
</div>



---
## Gamma density recap

- The .hlight[gamma density] will be useful as a prior for parameters that are strictly positive.

--

- If $\theta \sim \textrm{Ga}(a,b)$, we have the pdf
.block[
.small[
$$f(\theta) = \frac{b^a}{\Gamma(a)} \theta^{a-1}e^{-b\theta}.$$
]
]

  where $a$ is known as the .hlight[shape parameter] and $b$, the .hlight[rate parameter]. 
  
--

- Another parameterization uses the .hlight[scale parameter] $\phi = 1/b$ instead of $b$.

--

- Some properties:

  + $\mathbb{E}[\theta] = \dfrac{a}{b}$
  
  + $\mathbb{V}[\theta] = \dfrac{a}{b^2}$
  
  + $\textrm{Mode}[\theta] = \dfrac{a-1}{b} \ \ \textrm{for} \ \ a \geq 1$




---
## Gamma density

- If our prior guess of the expected count is $\mu$ & we have a prior "scale" $\phi$, we can let
.block[
.small[
$$\mathbb{E}[\theta] = \mu = \dfrac{a}{b}; \ \ \mathbb{V}[\theta] = \mu \phi = \dfrac{a}{b^2},$$
]
]

  and solve for $a$, $b$. We can play the same game if we have a prior variance or standard deviation.
  
  
--

- More properties:

  + If $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p \overset{ind}{\sim} \textrm{Ga}(a_i,b)$, then $\sum_i \theta_i \sim \textrm{Ga}(\sum_i a_i,b)$.

--
  + If $\theta \sim \textrm{Ga}(a,b)$, then for any $c > 0$, $c\theta \sim \textrm{Ga}(a,b/c)$.

--
  + If $\theta \sim \textrm{Ga}(a,b)$, then $1/\theta$ has an .hlight[Inverse-Gamma distribution]. 
  
--
  *We'll take advantage of these soon!*
  
  
  
---
## Example gamma distributions

```{r fig.height=4.5, echo=F}
x <- seq(0,5,by=0.00001)
plot(x,dgamma(x,shape=1,rate=1),xlim=c(0,5),ylim=c(0,1.5),lwd=1.5,type="l",
      col="green3",xlab=expression(theta),ylab="density")
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=2,rate=2),col="red2",lwd=1.5,type="l")
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=5,rate=2),col="blue2",lwd=1.5,type="l")
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=0.001,rate=0.001),col="orange3",lwd=1.5,type="l")
legend("topright", legend=c("gamma(1,1)","gamma(2,2)","gamma(5,2)","gamma(0.001,0.001)"),
       col=c("green3","red2","blue2","orange3"), lwd=2, cex=1)
```

*R has the option to specify either the rate or scale parameter so always make sure to specify correctly when using "dgamma","rgamma",etc!*.
